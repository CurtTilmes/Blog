DB::Pg -- PostgreSQL access for Perl6
-------------------------------------

I've been using [DBIish](https://github.com/perl6/DBIish) for interfacing
with PostgreSQL, but for a variety of reasons I decided to take another
approach.

I had been a fan of [Mojo::Pg](http://mojolicious.org/perldoc/Mojo/Pg) which
is a nice layer on top of Perl 5's `DBI`, and tried a few different ways of
making a similar layer on top of `DBIish`, but some of its internals 
prevented me from making it act the way I wanted.

The main thing I used `Mojo::Pg` for and wanted to do with Perl 6 is
maintaining database connections persisently while handling simultaneous
requests in a multi-threaded server.  (Now working with
[Cro](http://mi.cro.services/).)  I just want a simple way to either use an
existing database connection or create a new one, do a few database queries,
then return the connection to the pool until later needed.

Enter [Db::Pg](https://github.com/CurtTilmes/perl6-dbpg).

Rather than specifying connection information for each handle, you only
need to do that up front when you create the `DB::Pg` object.  It can
give you new database handles, or simply execute a query and return the
results.

```
my $pg = DB::Pg.new('host=localhost port=5432 dbname=mydb');

for $pg.query('select * from foo').hashes {
    .say
}
```

or more traditionally (note PostgreSQL style placeholders with $1, $2, etc.):

```
my $db = $pg.db;
my $sth = $db.prepare('insert into foo (x,y) values ($1,$2)');
$sth.execute(1, 'this');
$sth.execute(2, 'that');
$db.finish;
```

or in a transaction:

```
my $db = $pg.db;
my $sth = $db.prepare('insert into foo (x,y) values ($1,$2)');
$db.begin;
$sth.execute(1, 'this');
$sth.execute(2, 'that');
$db.commit.finish;
```

You can even query huge tables with a cursor:

```
for $pg.cursor('select * from foo') -> @row {
    say @row;
}
```

Anyway, check it out!
